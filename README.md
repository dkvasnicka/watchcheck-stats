WatchCheck stats
================

This is a simple utility that I wrote to extract some useful statistics from data exported from the
[WatchCheck app](https://17jewels.info/workbench/software/268-watchcheck2-en.html).

If you want to hack it I recommend using [reflex](https://github.com/cespare/reflex):
```
reflex --sequential -d none -c .reflex
```
